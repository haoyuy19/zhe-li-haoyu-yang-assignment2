                    Conwayâ€™s Game of Life (henceforth, Life) is based on a grid
                    system. Every individual location on the grid can be
                    understood as a cell. The game, or simulation, occurs over
                    iterations, or generations. After a generation, a cell may
                    change from living or dead based on how many living or dead
                    neighbors it had in a previous iteration. A neighbor is any
                    immediately adjacent spot on the grid (horizontal, vertical
                    or diagonal). We can understand this more clearly with an
                    example and a clear demonstration of the rules.

                <p style={pStyle}>Life has 4 simple rules:</p>

                    <li>
                        A living cell with less than two living neighbours dies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A living cell with two or three live neighbours lives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A living cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a
                        live cell, as if by reproduction.
