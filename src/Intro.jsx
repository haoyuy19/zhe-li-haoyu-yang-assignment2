                    Conwayâ€™s Game of Life (henceforth, Life) is based on a grid
                    system. Every individual location on the grid can be
                    understood as a cell. The game, or simulation, occurs over
                    iterations, or generations. After a generation, a cell may
                    change from living or dead based on how many living or dead
                    neighbors it had in a previous iteration. A neighbor is any
                    immediately adjacent spot on the grid (horizontal, vertical
                    or diagonal). We can understand this more clearly with an
                    example and a clear demonstration of the rules.

                        A living cell with less than two living neighbours dies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A living cell with two or three live neighbours lives.

                    <li>
                        A living cell with more than three live neighbours dies.

                        A dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a
                        live cell, as if by reproduction.

                        User can set the width and height for the game board.
                        The smallest possible grid should be 10 X 10 and the
                        biggest possible grid should be 100 X 100.
                    </li>
                    <li>Click initial to generate a random set of cells.</li>
                    <li>Click next to see the next generation.</li>
                    <li>Click start to start the simulation.</li>
                    <li>
                        Click pause to pause the simulation. User can click any
                        cell To reverse its state. For instance, if a cell is
                        dead and a user clicks on it, it should be marked as a
                        live.

                    <li>Click clear to reset the grid.</li>

                        Click Show Heat Map to see how recently a grid was
                        alive. When a cell is currently alive, it should be red.
                        When a cell has been dead for 10 or more iterations, it
                        should be white. The lighter the shade, the more acient
                        the cell.

                        User can input the frequency of updates to this
                        simulation at the speed of choice. The frequency of a
                        generation can be between 50 to 2000ms. This value can
                        only be set when the simulation is NOT running.
